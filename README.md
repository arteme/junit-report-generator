# JUnit Report Generator With Jinja2 Templates

Sometimes you need to generate a custom JUnit report
off-line and standard reports generated by tools like
Gradle just don't cut it.

There's always XSLT, but how about something a tad
more human-friendly?

Here is a small tool that combines the power or python
junitparser package with that of jinja2 templating library.

## Usage

    ./junit-report-generator.py <jinja2 template> <junit xml> [<junit xml> ...]
